#!/usr/bin/env ipython

# *** How to have the most comfort scripting experience of your life ***
# ######################################################################
#
# â€¦ by using ipython for scripting combined with subcommands from bash!
#
# 1. echo "#!/usr/bin/env ipython3" > scriptname.ipy    # creates new ipy-file
#
# 2. chmod +x scriptname.ipy                            # make in executable
#
# 3. starting with line 2, write normal python or do some of
#    the ! magic of ipython, so that you can use unix commands
#    within python and even assign their output to a variable via
#    var = !cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3                          # enjoy ;)
#
# 4. run via ./scriptname.ipy - if it fails with recognizing % and !
#    but parses raw python fine, please check again for the .ipy suffix

# ugly example, please go and find more in the wild
files = !ls *.* | grep "params.txt"
print files
for file in files:
    readFile = open(file)
    lines = readFile.readlines()
    readFile.close()
    w = open(file, 'w')
    lines = lines[:-1]
    lines.append("maxGen = 1e8 \n")
    lines.append("geom = sphere \n")
    w.writelines([item for item in lines])
    w.close()
# sorry for this nonsense example ;)
